# SpringIsComing
You have learned .NET or other platforms in a long time. Maybe, You've never known anything else. But now Spring is truly coming. In the Spring, we must teach each other or prepare by ourselves.

# Rewrite from some conversation from the "GOT" series film:
"You were born in the long summer. You've never known anything else. But now winter is truly coming. And in the winter, we must protect ourselves, look after one another".
